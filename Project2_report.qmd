# Introduction

## Data description

The dataset is from `gamlss.data` package [@harrell2002PlasmaRetinolBetaCarotene]. It is a cross-sectional study to investigate the relationship between personal characteristics and dietary factors, and plasma concentrations.

An original data frame has 315 observations of the following variables

| Variable        | Description                                             |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

| `sex`           | sex, 1=male, 2=female                                   |

| `bmi`           | body mass index weight/(height\^2)                      |
| `vituse`        | vitamin use 1=yes, fairly often, 2=yes, not often, 3=no |
| `calories`      | number of calories consumed per day                     |
| `fat`           | grams of fat consumed per day                           |
| `fiber`         | grams of fiber consumed per day                         |
| `alcohol`       | number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week            |
| `cholesterol`   | cholesterol consumed (mg per day)                       |
| `betadiet`      | dietary beta-carotene consumed (mcg per day)            |
| `retdiet`[^1]   | dietary retinol consumed (mcg per day)                  |
| `betaplasma`    | plasma beta-carotene (ng/ml)                            |
| `retplasma`[^2] | plasma retinol (ng/ml)                                  |

We import the data

```{r}
plasma_df <- read_csv("data/plasma.txt", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

> Observational studies have suggested that low dietary intake or low plasma concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, or other carotenoids might be associated with increased risk of developing certain types of cancer... We designed a cross-sectional study to investigate the relationship between personal characteristics and dietary factors, and plasma concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene and other carotenoids.

# Multivariate regression

 glmnet requires a model-matrix as the model specification.
 A model matrix is a matrix with a column for each predictor (=x-variable) in the model (including the extra columns for polynomials, dummy variables etc), and each row is for a unique observation.
 Sometimes the model-matrix includes a column for the intercept, in glmnet it should (typically) not.

```{r}
#head(plasma_df)
x <- model.matrix(log(betaplasma) ~ ., plasma_df)[, -1]
#head(x)
y <- log(plasma_df$betaplasma)
#head(y)
```

```{r}
# Grid of lambdas
grid <- 10^seq(10, -2, length = 100) #grid 

# Run ridge regression (alpha =0) for each lambda in grid
ridge.mod <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 0, lambda = grid)
```

The `ridge.mod` contains `r dim(coef(ridge.mod))[1]` rows and `r dim(coef(ridge.mod))[2]` columns corresponding to the number of $\lambda$ values we created earlier.

```{r}
# Prepare for cross validation by splitting the data in training and validation set
set.seed(42)
train <- sample(1:nrow(x), nrow(x) / 2)
test <- (-train)
y.test <- y[test]

```

```{r}
# Fit ridge regression on the training data, for our grid of lambda
ridge.mod <- glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 0,
    lambda = grid, thresh = 1e-12)
# Find predictions for our testdata for a specific lambda (here lambda =4)
ridge.pred <- predict(ridge.mod, s = 4, newx = x[test, ])

```

The MSE for the $\lambda = 4$ is `r mean((ridge.pred - y.test)^2)`. @fig-ridge-plot1 shows the ridge model ceofficients that ,mksjdhfgkdfgjh
 
```{r}
#| label: fig-ridge-plot1
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-cap: A graph of the ridge model coefficients for different lambdas
plot(ridge.mod,xvar="lambda",lwd=1.5)
```
```{r}
## 10-fold CV to evaluate test error for different lamdas 
set.seed(1)
cv.out <- cv.glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 0)
plot(cv.out)
# Choose the best:
bestlam <- cv.out$lambda.min
```

The best $\lambda=`r bestlam`$

```{r}
# MSE associated with this lambda
ridge.pred <- predict(ridge.mod, s = bestlam,
    newx = x[test, ])
mean((ridge.pred - y.test)^2)

```


Lasso

# Random Forest

We will now use the random forest algorithm implemented in `randomForest` package in R.

```{r}
rf_fit <- randomForest(log(betaplasma)~., data=plasma_df,
                       subset = train, mtry=12, importance=TRUE)
```

The parameter `mtry` determines how many columns are consered for each split. We will have to cross-validate this parameter to make sure we are not overfitting to our dataset. For now, we try to split at each one of the variables. The @fig-rf-predicted-true1 shows the predicted values against the true values for the test portion of our dataset.

```{r}
#| label: fig-rf-predicted-true1
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-cap: "Predicted vs true values for random forest algorithm"
rf_pred <- predict(rf_fit, newdata = plasma_df[test,])
plot(rf_pred, log(plasma_df$betaplasma)[test],
     ylab="log(betaplasma)", xlab="predicted")
abline(0,1)
```

The test MSE for random forest is `r mean((rf_pred-log(plasma_df$betaplasma[test]))^2)`, which is pretty impressive. As for any tree-based algorithm, interpretability is usually an issue. We can use the special function in the `randomForest` package to see which variables were most frequently used in the tree splits (@fig-rf-varimp1).


```{r}
#| label: fig-rf-varimp1
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-cap: "Variable importance plot for random forest with mtry 12"
varimp_m <- importance(rf_fit) #matrix form
varImpPlot(rf_fit, main="")
```

It seems like `r glue::glue_collapse(names(sort(varimp_m[,1], decreasing = TRUE)[1:5]), sep=", ", last=", and ")` are the most important variables for predicting the level of beta-carotene in plasma.

We will now determine the best value of `mtry` parameter to use in our random forest model. @fig-rfcv shows the out-of-fold MSE for the models with different `mtry`.  

```{r}
#| label: fig-rfcv
#| fig-cap: "Cross-validated performance of random forest"
#| out-width: "80%"
set.seed(42)
cvrf_obj <- randomForest::rfcv(x, y)
with(cvrf_obj, plot(n.var, error.cv, log="x", type="o", lwd=2))
bestvars <- which.min(cvrf_obj$error.cv)
```

It seems like the model with `r paste("mtry=", cvrf_obj$n.var[bestvars])` had the best out-of-fold performance. The @fig-rfcv-bst-predactual shows the predicted vs the actual values from the best model.

```{r}
#| label: fig-rfcv-bst-predactual
#| fig-cap: "Predicted vs actual values for the best model"
#| out-width: "80%"
plot(cvrf_obj$predicted[[bestvars]], y, xlab="predicted", ylab="actual")
abline(0,1)
```

This means that our original model was right and we can report that the best out-of-fold estimate of MSE for the random forest model is `r cvrf_obj$error.cv[bestvars]`.
